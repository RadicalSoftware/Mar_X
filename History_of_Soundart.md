## Christoph Cox – History of Sound Art
#### 1:23:40 - 1:31:40

Amazing film, filmed with GoPro cameras largely, attached to the fishermen’s arms and heads and whatever. So, it is a very, kind of, visually disorienting film, but it is I think the sound that helps to take that image, which is always flat and right there in-front of you... and really kind of makes that image envelop you. And I will show the trailer, this is the commercial trailer for it… there it is. And the trailer is just a clip from the film, it’s a particular clip from the film, but I really 
encourage you to see it. One of the reasons why… the sound design is done by Ernst Karel, who is a fantastic sound artist , 
a guy who does field recording and presents his work in various kind of more sound art context. But he is the manager for 
the Sensory Ethnography Lab and also the guy who does all their sound... and really the film is so extraordinary sonically and 
really an example of film as a kind of sonic art. So here is the trailer.

O.K. So, I know I’ve gone a little longer than I’ve hoped, than I’ve expected, but I’m happy to answer any questions, 
or take comments. Whatever. Thank you very much. Questions… Comments…

Do you think we are maybe, culturally, in the midst of a change, from taking what we often dispersally just dump into a general category of noise and learning to understand that, in multitudinous ways, that help as to understand maybe our place in the world, or what the world has to offer?

(Cox)

Yes, it’s a good question. I mean of-course, I think really over… I was gonna say it is over the history of the twentieth 
century, but it is possibly the history of any century in a certain sense, that is attentive to noise in various ways, but
we’ve made it a cultural artefact and aesthetic entity, that maybe other centuries haven’t. And yes, the question of the shift,why the shift, and why are we doing in the late 20th and early 21st century, what we see someone like Russello short of inviting as to do in the beginning of the 20th. What are these kind of cultural moments? I don’t know that I am enough of a 
historian to be able to sort out all of the kind of reasons for that, but yes… there has been a cultural shift, I think, 
in a significant way.

Thank you, that was great. I actually just was into a podcast about how we kind of (no sound), and I’m curious if you think 
kind of (no sound) is our way of tapping back into that sense, through sound art and thought (no sound) , obvious use of sound 
or is it just (no sound) how can we (no sound)

(Cox)

Before that talk today, I was talking about the different ways we approach sound and image, right? So… I guess  I was saying  
this isn’t something kind of unique to me.
